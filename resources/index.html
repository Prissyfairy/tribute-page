                <p>Kente is a Ghanaian fabric, Kente is a brightly colored, banded material and is the most widely known cloth produced in Africa. Although kente cloth is now identified with the Akan people in West Africa, and particularly the Asante Kingdom, the term originates with the neighboring Fante people. Kente cloth is closely related to Adinkra cloth, which has symbols stenciled into cloth and is associated with special occassion. ​Among the Asante (or Ashanti) people of Ghana, West Africa, a popular legend relates how two young men—Ota Karaban and his friend Kwaku Ameyaw—learned the art of weaving by observing a spider weaving its web. One night, the two went out into the forest to check their traps, and they were amazed by a beautiful spider’s web whose many unique designs sparkled in the moonlight. The spider, named Ananse, offered to show the men how to weave such designs in exchange for a few favors. After completing the favors and learning how to weave the designs with a single thread, the men returned home to Bonwire (Bonwire is the town in the Asante region of Ghana where kente weaving originated), and their discovery was soon reported to Asantehene Osei Tutu, first ruler of the Asante kingdom. The asantehene adopted their creation, named kente, as a royal cloth reserved for special occasions, and Bonwire became the leading kente weaving center for the asantehene and his court.</p>

                <p>This involves the planning and designing of the kente patterns to be woven on a square paper with vertical and horizontal sections or preferably by the use of a graph sheet. In the design on the graph sheet, the vertical column indicates the warp yarns while the horizontal column stands for the weft yarns.

                    Warping: This is the process of obtaining and determining the length of warp yarns and the total number of ends as well as the colour patterns of the warp yarns to be used for the kente weaving. It also assists greatly in securing the crosses in the warp for easy identification. Warping is carried out on a warping mill or warping board.
                    
                    Beaming: This is the winding of the warp yarns onto the roller after the raddle is used to spread and stretch the warp yarns.
                    
                     Heddling: This is the passing of the individual warp ends through the eye of the healds with the aid of a heddle hook. The heddling order depends on the weave plan and this has to be designed to know how to draw each of the ends through the eyes of the heddle. A loom with two heddle frames to be used for the production of a plain weave has the heddling order as 1,2, 1,2 while a four heddle frames loom has the heddling order as 1,2,3,4, 1,2,3,4.</p>

                <p>Kente is a meaningful sartorial device, as every aspect of its aesthetic design is intended as communication. The colors of the cloth each hold symbolism: gold = status/serenity, yellow = fertility, green = renewal, blue = pure spirit/harmony, red = passion, black = union with ancestors/spiritual awareness. Due to beautiful bright colors, kente is use for important occassions that are memorable.
